Financial Analysis Using Power BI
The Financial Analysis Using Power BI project enables businesses to gain insightful financial analysis through interactive dashboards, utilizing data from multiple dimensions like categories, geography, products, sales reps, and subcategories. This project uses Power BI to visualize and analyze sales data from 2014 to 2017, empowering decision-makers with actionable insights into sales performance, profitability, and growth trends.

Project Overview
This project integrates sales data from multiple years (2014–2017) and organizes it through various dimension tables such as categories, geography, product, sales reps, and subcategories. The financial analysis is performed by connecting these datasets within Power BI to create comprehensive dashboards and reports that track performance, trends, and financial health over time.

Datasets
The following datasets are used in the analysis:

Dimension Tables:

Categories: Defines the product categories.
Geography: Geographic regions where sales data is recorded.
Product: Information about products sold.
SalesRep: Sales representative information.
SubCategories: Breakdown of products into subcategories.
Sales Data (Excel):

Sales 2014: Sales data for the year 2014.
Sales 2015: Sales data for the year 2015.
Sales 2016: Sales data for the year 2016.
Sales 2017: Sales data for the year 2017.

Key Features
Dynamic Dashboards: Interactive Power BI dashboards to track and visualize key financial metrics and sales trends.
Year-over-Year Analysis: Compare and analyze sales data across multiple years (2014–2017).
Sales Performance Insights: Evaluate performance by categories, geography, product, sales reps, and subcategories.
Trend Analysis: Visualize sales growth, profit margins, and identify areas for improvement.
Custom KPIs: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like total sales, profit margin, sales growth rate, and more.
Data Integration: Integration of multiple Excel datasets to analyze data across different dimensions.

Technologies Used
Power BI: Used for data visualization, dashboard creation, and reporting.
Excel: Sales data and dimension tables are stored in Excel files.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for calculating custom KPIs, aggregations, and performance metrics.
Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation within Power BI.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following:

Power BI Desktop: Download Power BI Desktop
Sales Data Excel Files: Ensure you have the Excel files containing the sales data for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, as well as dimension tables (categories, geography, products, sales reps, subcategories).
Installation and Setup

Download Power BI Desktop:
Download and install Power BI Desktop from the official website.

Import Data:
Open Power BI and use the "Get Data" option to import your Sales Data (Excel files).
Import each of the dimension tables (categories, geography, product, sales reps, subcategories) and the sales data files (2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017).

Data Transformation:
Use Power Query to clean and transform the data:
Remove unnecessary columns.
Handle missing or inconsistent data.
Merge the sales data with relevant dimension tables (categories, geography, etc.).

Data Modeling:
Create relationships between the dimension tables and sales data.
Use Power BI’s modeling tools to link tables such as connecting sales data to product categories, geography, and sales reps.

Create KPIs & Metrics:
Use DAX to create custom financial metrics such as:
Total Sales: Sum of all sales amounts.

Profit Margin: (Profit / Total Sales).
Year-over-Year Growth: (Sales This Year - Sales Last Year) / Sales Last Year.

Build Dashboards:
Create interactive visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables for analyzing sales performance by year, category, product, region, and sales rep.

Publish and Share:
After creating the reports and dashboards, you can publish them to the Power BI Service for online access and sharing with stakeholders.
