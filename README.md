### üõ†Ô∏è **Installation and Setup**

1. **Download Power BI Desktop**:
   - Download and install Power BI Desktop from the [official website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/downloads/).

2. **Import Data**:
   - Open Power BI and use the "Get Data" option to import your **Sales Data** (Excel files).
   - Import each of the **dimension tables** (categories, geography, product, sales reps, subcategories) and the **sales data files** (2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017).

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Use **Power Query** to clean and transform the data:
     - Remove unnecessary columns.
     - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
     - Merge the sales data with relevant dimension tables (categories, geography, etc.).

4. **Data Modeling**:
   - Create relationships between the dimension tables and sales data.
   - Use Power BI‚Äôs modeling tools to link tables such as connecting sales data to product categories, geography, and sales reps.

5. **Create KPIs & Metrics**:
   - Use **DAX** to create custom financial metrics such as:
     - **Total Sales**: Sum of all sales amounts.
     - **Profit Margin**: `(Profit / Total Sales)`.
     - **Year-over-Year Growth**: `(Sales This Year - Sales Last Year) / Sales Last Year`.

6. **Build Dashboards**:
   - Create interactive visualizations such as:
     - **Bar Charts**: Display sales performance by year, category, product, region, and sales rep.
     - **Line Graphs**: Show sales trends and growth.
     - **Pie Charts**: Visualize product and category share.
     - **Tables**: Provide detailed financial data analysis.
